495009669,3,France,"Having already arrived without any expectation, we were even more disappointed by the quality of their best rides. All of us were over 20 yo so we had targeted rides with height warnings such as Iron Man Experience, Grizzly Gulch, Speed Racer, and Hyperspace Mountain etc. Iron Man was the most disappointing of them all, as the '4DX' movie was too short, had an unimaginative storyline and was by far the worst disney ride. Hyperspace Mountain had been bought by Star Wars and its opening tune as we rode into pitch black was exciting and familiar. The ride was probably the best one and we went on it 3 times, but the lighting wasnt perhaps too bright and we could see some of the roller coaster's structure, which sort of ruined the  space illusion , unlike the one in Paris. Grizzly Gulch, an outdoor coaster, was also graced by our bums 3 times as well. To be fair, there was nothing wrong with the ride (it even had a surprise factor) however we were used to the likes of alton towers and our experienced and wise selves craved a higher thrill factor.

The Space Mountain ride here is less, I would say, traumatic, haha, of the rides. The Orlando one is kind of scary and the Paris one kind of sprained my neck. So, I enjoyed this one the best. The only downside of the park is that on crowded days there are a lot of mainlanders visiting and will try to cut in line and push their way in which is really annoying. Just come prepared and chill. The rides are few but fun and the new Toy Story part is great. One tip: on crowded days use the single lines and you will get on the ride faster. Since my kids are now older and yes, they do still enjoy Disney, we were able to do that.

There were no problems with queues   I think the longest we waited for a ride was 20 minutes (we went on a monday). It seemed the rides more suited to young children had the longest queues whereas Space Mountain we only waited 5 minutes each time! One of the highlights of our day were the shows   Lion King and The Golden Mickeys   really professional shows and the Lion King was like a shorter version of the West End production.

199106576,4,France,"Oh, it's all TERRIBLY well done and everything. It should be: a day for a family of five costs about $450 before refreshments and souvenirs. Some of the rides are great: my particular faves (and I am 47, it should be pointed out) being the Indiana Jones thing, Splash Mountain & the Star Wars business.I think the experience was enhanced by not having to queue a great deal. This was because we were there on a day that was   apparently   not busy, though there didn't seem to be any shortage of crowds about. The longest we had to wait was 30 odd minutes and that was to take my youngest for a ride in a plastic elephant. The adverts show a child skipping down a deserted Main Street or some such hand in hand with Mickey Mouse: in reality the crowds are far too dense and passageways clogged with obese people on mobility scooters for anyone to skip anywhere at all and you have to wait for half an hour to get 15 seconds with an actress disguised rather unconvincingly as that lass from  Brave.  We demurred at this.If we'd had to wait two hours for things, this would not be a 4 5 review.My tips for surviving Disney without committing multiple infanticide:1. Do your homework. Decide which rides you really must not miss and plan your day accordingly. The Fastpass system can be your friend here (it's free, by the way), but note that for very popular rides at peak times you can wait an age for the pass machine and then still die of old age in the  fast  queue.2. The food in the park is both pricey and vile. Consider smuggling your own rations in. Bags are searched at the gate by ninjas disguised as little old ladies, but they don't actually pat you down, so secrete sandwiches about your person. Or eat an extra big breakfast and just skip lunch.3. Go on a  quiet  day. March just before Spring Break was good. People apparently spend more than one day visiting Disney. God knows how they manage it. I'd be driven to drink.Still, the children loved it, which was rather the point, and I think that if I am to have a once in a lifetime Disney experience (and believe me, it will be) I'd far rather it was at the original park than at one of the newer ones.

Granted we did go during the winter holiday, but waiting 60 to 80mins for 2mins rides was frustrating.  Some rides were also randomly closed for a few hours and then reopened.  As a result we didn't cover the totality of the park.  I would suggest doing the rides you really like during the parade. Queues are minimal at that time.  We found it hard to circulate in the park because of an excess amount of mobility scooters. Please note that I'm NOT talking about wheelchairs or pushchairs! Obviously we do not discriminate and don't think anyone should be excluded from having fun. I won't go into the details of what we heard, but I will say that the scooters should be for those with health issues and not for pure enjoyment.The one thing that really surprised us is how tiny the castle is.

You can buy products and ask them to keep them to collect later or have them delivered to the main Disney store in Disney Village.There are many restaurants and some have some veg options, like fries and salads.

There are also many food trucks selling popcorn, pommel d'amour  caramel apples , ice creams, and other drinks.We got a one day 2 park pass, although I'd recommend you to get just one day one park, because it takes a lot of time going from one park to another, and you can't do any properly.

Restaurants   for lunch we went to the Plaza Garden restaurant for a lunch buffet, it was a long wait at the entrance to pay and to be seated, and I seriously don't understand how can it take that long. There were just 2 prices: adult or kids, and perhaps some drinks, how difficult is it? Based on my observation it took approximately 10 minutes for each group of people. There were plenty of tables inside the restaurant, and there is a decent selection of food, it's just the wait at the entrance that almost sent us away. They really need to improve the efficiency, perhaps by not asking people for their drinks choice at the till, but after they are seated. 2. Restaurant choices for the evening. There are firework displays at 8pm and I believe most people would stay for the fireworks before leaving. However most restaurants are closed before 7pm, eg the fish and chip place closes at 5.30pm. WHY??? We went to the fast food restaurant in the  discovery land    completely overpriced, a kids burger plus fries, drinks and a small dessert is 8.99 euro and an adult burger set starts at 12.99 euro   and the food weren't even that great. Look at the dessert, I can do a better job...3. Smoke   I'm not the only one who comment about this issue, there are too many smokers around and inhaling smoke isn't a good idea for kids. Perhaps this can be improved by imposing designated smoking areas, and it's prohibited elsewhere in the park?4. There is an app which tells you about ride waiting time, and restaurant opening time, it could be improved by letting people to filter restaurants that are opened for dinner. eg have a look at the Puy du Fou one, it tells you what's going on at what time, at a glance, and which restaurants are still opened.All in all, it's a fun day out, my son loves it, but we are frustrated with the restaurants.

523121786,3,France,"I'm a native Californian who has been to Disneyland in Anaheim probably 100 times (no joke), so obviously I have a bias. Many beautiful memories have been created there.In 2013, my grown daughter and I were in Paris and decided to go to Disneyland. We had no idea what to expect, except we thought it would be similar to the Anaheim park. Wow, were we disappointed. We knew right away that something was amiss when we heard no music playing at the entrance. There wasn't a flower to be seen anywhere (this was in April!), and we were actually starving for food. I mean, no food at Disneyland? Criminal. We found just ONE restaurant open, and the food was mediocre to terrible. A real disappointment. The rides, too, were quite different from the original    mostly rollercoasters (even Indiana Jones). Overall, it was a depressing experience, and we vowed never to go back.And then ... we decided to give it another try. We went again in early Sept. 2017, on a day that ended up being pretty rainy and blustery. But up until then, we were pleasantly surprised at the improvements they have made to the park (both the Disneyland side and the Studios side). There was wonderful music playing everywhere and flowers blooming (although they could still do more with the landscaping). New rides had come along, including Ratatouille, which we loved. The whole Pirates area was pretty cool, too. While the park still doesn't have the sparkle and magic of the original Disneyland, it has charm. The light and fireworks show on the castle at night was well done.The people running the rides seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs, and they were fun to interact with. We had fun in both parks.Having said that, we noticed two major problems: 1) The food: Where is it? Yes, this time there were a few more places open, but most of the small carts served exactly the same thing (weird!). Also, at dinnertime    and in the rain    we searched for an open restaurant, and nearly all of them were closed. What? We finally found one that was open, where an average dinner started at $25! We wandered around (getting soaked) and finally found one place that was more reasonably priced. But we passed restaurant after restaurant that were closed at 7 pm. What gives? The food we did eat was passable, but not very good. This time, we brought our own lunch    we saw a lot of other people doing the same thing. They're losing a lot of money by not fixing this problem. But we thought for sure we'd be able to find a decent place for dinner. Wrong!2) The service: They need to hire more people. This was evident in both the shops and the food service areas, where service was so slow, it was ridiculous. At one of the small food carts, we waited 10 minutes to get to the front of the line    and we were behind ONE person! But we were so hungry, we decided to stick it out. The park also isn't as clean as it should be. We noticed trash in some areas, which we never see at the Disneyland in Anaheim. The bathrooms were OK but could be shinier. This park could be so much better with some minor adjustments: more and tastier food options, more service workers, more attention to the look and feel (more flowers and fun things to look at, please!), some better rides (get rid of the Rock 'n' Rollercoaster, that was actually silent    no rock music playing, which was bizarre). But the park is improving. Perhaps it was gussied up for its 25th anniversary and won't stay that way, but I hope that they keep going in this direction. If so, then we would go back, since we now live nearby.If you're an American who has been to the original Disneyland, going to this park will seem a bit surreal to you.

It's ridiculously easy to access by public transport from Central Paris and as we got there pretty much as soon as the gates opened (and even then, not really, a good 30mins after), we walked straight through.

499501842,3,France,"We decided to visit the iconic French Disney park once again (July 4th) to celebrate the arrival of summer. This is not my first time visiting Disneyland Paris, and I am globally satisfied and have enjoyed my previous visits. However, this visit was slightly disappointing. I decided to bring my friend to the park for her birthday as it would be a nice experience as last time she went she was only very small. We left early on a Tuesday morning (hoping there would be fewer people   oh boy were we wrong) and arrived at the main park around 9:30 AM. A large crowd had already gathered in front of the main entrance, eager to be let in and go on rides. As the doors finally opened, we walked towards Big Thunder Mountain to find it closed. Yes, at opening time, the main attraction of Frontierland was closed. We waited for a solid 45 minutes before the staff finally decided that the ride was safe to use. (they had given us no reason to why it was closed. and by the time it has opened, a huge crowd had gathered behind us.) We were off to a bad start. After that, we went on a couple of rides before beelining to the new Hyperspace Mountain. We used the single rider line as it goes much quicker than the regular one (50minutes wait on regular, 15 on single rider!). However, after 10 minutes of waiting in queue, one side of the attraction broke down. So the waiting time doubled for both queues. (The ride was totally worth it though! Amazing!) We walked out and almost every ride had huge amounts of queue. Especially rides like Peter Pan (70 Minutes). Patience is needed in Disneyland Paris. There is a lot of standing and waiting. We then moved on towards the Studios which were even more crowded than the main park. All the rides there had 50 minute plus queues. We did the Tower of Terror (Which was only about 30 Seconds long for 1 Hour of queue but had an interesting backstory) and then proceeded to Ratatouille. This one, however, was less stressful as we could use another Single Rider queue. (the ride was also incredible) We didn't bother with the other attractions as by now we were starving. We headed back to the main park and searched for lunch. We found a nice restaurant in one of the lands and had a reasonably priced meal which consisted of Chicken wings and chips. (10 Euros for one person   The food was good and I was very happy, even though we had to queue even more for the food. Yes, the service was horrifically slow. 20Minutes wait to order our food. This is a fast food restaurant I'll remind you.) Every ride has a scary amount of wait, but luckily the beautiful scenery of this Disney Park was enough to satisfy my friend. We had a lot of fun  hiking  in the Adventure Land and rode the Indiana Jones Ride. Which again, is another very short ride for a ridiculous queue. We ended up leaving early, having done only a couple of rides. However, the park itself is frankly beautiful and is eye candy to look at. We obviously didn't leave without doing a little shopping. Everything in the shops is pricey, and even the smallest, tiniest, made in China keychain will cost about 7 euros, so you're child's allowance won't be enough for a souvenir. Usually, you can do both Disney Paris parks in a day when it's not too crowded, (Go on a French school day.) but if you're coming from far, take your time and use the hotel's special resident hours to do some of the rides.

497226640,5,France,"Very pleased to finally do a review for this magical place. I went to Disneyland for the first time 24years ago, 1year ago after its grand opening and have been back there almost every other year. I really enjoy going there again and again. You always discover something new. I even like just walking through the parks and looking at all the details and just enjoy the atmosphere more than going on rides all day long. I just took my kid for the first time to Disneyland and just seeing the magic in his eyes was priceless.Ok so before going to Disneyland, you need to understand a few things: the park will be crowed if you go on a weekend or during vacations, you will most likely NOT be able to do all rides as you   ll have to wait in line for most of them. And the day will cost you a lot of money because nothing is cheap there. Once you understand that, you will have a great time in Disney, and if you are not ok with either the crowd or spending a good amount of money then I would not recommend going there; I   m not saying it   s normal, I   m just saying that   s how it is.Anyway, the parks are very well maintained and clean. They rides are short but all enjoyable. All personnel are very nice (yes they have strict guidelines, but still). Both parks are so huge that you could spend a few days in each.Just take your time and enjoy not only the rides but all the decorations as well. Take your time to take pictures with all the Disney characters as you will bump into them all over the park.There are few good but expensive restaurants in the park or a lot of fast food choices.I will definitely go back again and again to both Parks. It   s even more magical to go there with kids. And if you take tickets in advance you can always find cheap deals.I would put 6 stars to this review if I could.",Disneyland_Paris,2017,unknown,Europe,positive,0.95,positive,neutral,not_mentioned,positive,negative,negative,positive,not_mentioned,families,unknown,True,returning,none,unknown,unknown,weekend,True,False,False,True,False,False,multiple_days,Disneyland,True,yes,crowds and high costs,during_visit,moderate,long,good,True

Unfortunately, the ride Space Mountain was closed as they are changing the theme to Star Wars. It's always nice to take a ride in the train or go for a ride in Star Tours (3D now!).

439821488,4,France,"Disneyland Paris has become my weekend get away.I can't help but feel happy and relaxed anytime I visit. The castle is simply stunning and feels truly magical.There's attractions for all ages and thrill tastes. Fantasyland is great for young children, whereas Discovery Land with Space Mountain Mission 2 and Star Tours (once it re opens) is great for teens and adults. However, regardless of which land you go too, you probably find something for everyone.Unfortunately, now I've been to the original Disneyland in California and have a point of comparison, there are some flaws with the Paris offering.First and foremost is that although Disneyland Paris has inherited the  no selfie sticks  and  no smoking outside of designated areas  rule from it's US counterparts, the park staff do a terrible job of enforcing this rule. It is not uncommon to walk around and have vape or cigarette smoke blown straight into your face.Some areas of the park are in real need of TLC too. There's so many busted lightbulbs etc, dotted around (on the park entrance sign the word LAND doesn't even illuminate) which really doesn't meet the Disney quality bar.The merchandise offering is also a lot poorer than the US parks. Most stores will simply stock the same stuff that you can find in Disney Stores or the World of Disney shop you don't even need to pay for park access to get into. That being said, there is a decent enough selection   but if you loved all the boutiques and speciality stores you can find in Disneyland, CA or Walt Disney World, don't expect to find anything of the sort in Paris.However, for all its flaws, I simply love to come to Disneyland Paris. The night time fireworks are truly beautiful, and there's just something magical about going underneath the Disneyland Hotel to get into the Park proper.Disneyland Paris really is the type of park you'll only get out of it what you'll put into it. There's not quite as many spontaneous interactions as you'll find in the US parks, but if you make an effort to interact with the characters, the parade, or even the cast members   you'll have some truly magical experiences.The park is also currently undergoing a substantial amount of refurbishment to attractions like Big Thunder Mountain, Alice's Maze, Star Tours (and soon Space Mountain), so things definitely do look to be on the up.(Assuming you're in Europe) If you don't have the means, or desire, to make an international trip to the US parks, then Disneyland Paris is well worth a look.",Disneyland_Paris,2016,unknown,Europe,positive,0.85,positive,not_mentioned,not_mentioned,negative,negative,not_mentioned,negative,not_mentioned,couples,unknown,False,frequent,none,weekend,unknown,weekend,True,False,True,False,False,False,weekend,Space Mountain Mission 2;Star Tours;Big Thunder Mountain;Alice's Maze,True,yes,Poor enforcement of park rules and cleanliness issues,during_visit,moderate,long,good,True

Whilst there is lots on Tripadvisor about the rides, atmosphere, shows, and all the other amazing things about the place so I'll skip a review on the self evident greatness of the place but I wanted to highlight the excellent care we had yesterday. Our son and a girl bumped into each other. He fell awkwardly and hit the ground hard head first. He briefly lost consciousness and was in pain. A member of staff was with us almost immediately and called the Disney medical team who took us to their first aid centre, which is like a mini medical centre hidden behind a shop front just off Main Street. They were excellent, checked him over and gave us an advice sheet. All seemed ok so we decided to leave the park and head home. Just outside the ticket gate and still in the secure area he started vomiting. We called for help and had 5 or 6 helpful and friendly staff with us quickly. They offered water and reassurance that help was on its way. We went back to the medical centre and they called an ambulance and we went to A&E. Why is this a story to share on Tripadvisor? Because it was a silly accident of no fault of Disney whatsoever but they treated us with utmost care, gave a Mickey soft toy to my son, and a Minnie toy to my daughter, with colouring books for the inevitable wait at A&E, made sure we were all ok and gave very good level of care.

384568102,4,France,"I am a Paris resident, but still was not gathering courage to visit the Disneyland Paris all by myself. I was encouraged by Rubysgirl28, thank you :)So, I ventured into this family place all by myself and I was in for surprise. I travelled from Paris, it is only 35 minutes from the Paris Chatlete and it is very convenient. So, for those, who want to stay in Paris and visit, it is possible.I had 1 day 2 Parks ticket. I reached the place before it opened, which I highly recommend. The initial reaction to the design and the place, when not many people are around, is amazing.I did the Disneyland Park first, as there are more things to do. After lunch and seeing the Minnie's spring train, I went to Walt Disney Studio Park. I did almost all the open attractions, benefitting from single rider (SR) queues. Unfortunately Ratatouille ride was closed, due to some technical fault. But I did others and the park closes at 6 PM, so I came back to the Disneyland Park for the BIG Parade. It was too crowded to enjoy it, but still worth it.The Park is undergoing renovations for the big events next year, many rides are closed. And that is why my rating is 4, otherwise I would have loved to give it an excellent rating. But since I had only 1 day pass, I could cover everything in 1 Day and whatever I wanted and I left after the fireworks.I did 20 rides in all, which is good. For some the waiting time was long, even if it was SR, but in the end I would say it was worth the wait.I had my own sandwiches, as I am a vegetarian and getting good choices can be tough for vegetarians. It is possible to carry a small bag. It is not allowed to click pictures, especially in the fast rides, but it is always good to have a camera. I could capture many pictures. The place is awesome. I even had the Minnie ear band that glows and is synchronized with the fire works!

They are so adept at it that if there is not a sufficient queue they orchestrate one by shutting half the ride down or limiting the number of operating vehicles in a ride. When it's 3 degrees and raining this is a very cynical and malevolent manoeuvre, but a very cost effective one for Disney. Queuing is mostly without cover and then you have to sit on wet seats. Children's Buggies have to be left in the rain. I've been going there for the last 20 years so have noticed the changes, or in some cases lack of. For instance the Pirates of the Caribbean was magical 20 years ago now its dark, dank and lacking any sense of fun. Our Grandchildren (4 & 7) hated it.We did love the Hollywood Tower ride which was a real thrill when you eventually get in the lift, which took 40 minutes with a Fastpass.In conclusion, if they put as much effort into the rides and customer satisfaction, as they do the shops it would be a better experience.

343402327,4,France,"Just sat down to give reviews of my last trip in Sept. '15, and then read some of yours before planning my next trip. I look at the TERRIBLE comments every so often just to get a kick out of folks who complain about bad service, etc, when most times those difficulties they suffer are self inflicted. One example is the folks who complain that they  showed up at our hotel at 11:30a and were told we couldn't access our room until after 3pm  or something close to that. Check the hotel website! It will tell you what the check in out times are. If not, then call the hotel for that information.When visiting any Disney theme park it is always better to stay on property as accessing the attractions is easy via their tram system. In Orlando we have stayed in condos at Old Key West, Swan & Dolphin (our fav) and the budget locations such as their All star Movies resort and All Star Sports resort. The All Star resorts are budget and geared toward kids, so don't book a couples week there, pick the Swan instead.In Paris stay at New York as it is a well appointed Disney Hotel.Complaints about restaurant availability are another subject I find amusing. Plan ahead would you? You made the travel hotel plans ahead of time, why not plan to make reservations for dining well in advance, too? Many sit down restaurants are booked well in advance, so plan ahead. Finally, if you search the web you can find reputable sites that graph the expected visiting population on any given day based on past Disney history. Plan to go during a slow period.

277766603,5,France,"When I read some of the reviews for Disneyland Park with complaints, comparisons and questions about missing  magic  I have to say I was a bit nervous and wondering if we had made a mistake to plan a day at Disneyland Paris. We were doing research here only after having made the decision to take two 6 year old boys for a one day visit from Lyon, taking the first and last Ouigo TGVs in the morning and that night. Our visit was for the children, after all, this is the reason we go to Disneyland. We had nothing to fear. The children were absolutely enchanted. The park is immense, beautifully designed, well organized, and thought out with the children's experience in mind. Just seeing these two boys so completely caught up in this was enough. It was an excellent park. This park is in France, and attracts a European public as well as some Americans. A lot of the people around us were speaking languages other than English, although all of the attractions featured announcements in English and in French. We found that the staff, when given the opportunity, were engaged and friendly and most of all made the children feel special. I can only imagine what it must be like to work in a job where you are bombarded with so many cultures coming together at once. Our experience with that in mind was excellent. Smiles, handshakes, speaking to the children on their level, wonderful. A tip for managing wait times   remember that there are children with accompanying adults, and then there is another kind of public at this park, the overgrown children. These are the people who think it is appropriate to be an adult and command a whole ride car that could accommodate 4 people, the ones who might complain because the  magic  is waning in the sunset of their prolonged childhood. Observe them, steer clear of them, but also keep them in mind   remember they tend to stop for lunch precisely at noon and tire in the afternoon due to physical adult fatigue   so take your children to eat early (11:00 for instance) and take advantage of their habits to get on popular rides at noon and also in the late afternoon when these people are hunting for food.We found the Disney phone app very useful in monitoring wait times   keeping in mind also flexibility, not fixing to any specific schedule allowed the children to fall upon rides with shorter lines. We were very pleasantly surprised by many of the rides and attractions that don't get mentioned in reviews, and we allowed the children to choose where they want to go based on what they saw (we didn't plan much). There's plenty of fun to be had just exploring (Alice's labyrinth, & the cave with the dragon, the whole pirate cove playground area are nice distractions for boys between rides).Take snacks and water, they are very very expensive at the snack kiosks. We accidentally saved at least 20 euros by bringing our own water bottles. There are drinking fountains located throughout the park where you can fill them. When it was time to eat, we noticed that it isn't interesting to try and compare for value on the money between restaurants, they are all run by the same company, after all, and the dozens of different restaurants are all going to cost two to three times what you might pay for the same thing outside of Disney's gates. Be prepared to accept this or plan accordingly with a picnic.Disneyland Park is, overall, an excellent way to spend a day with children. On the train back home and the end of his day, my son said he wished he could live at Disneyland, which speaks volumes about how they made it into a beautiful bustling world to explore with seemingly endless detail.

237579467,3,France,"There isn't much information online about the Disneyland Halloween Party so here's my review of this year's event to help you decide if it's worth going next year.Good: Visitors in fantastic costumes, Mickey's Halloween Parade, fun to experience rides at night timeBad: Far too busy, not enough street entertainment, not enough lighting in Adventureland, not many spontaneous character appearances, no sweet giveaways (I heard that last year there people giving out sweets  maybe I'm wrong?)The park was open for Halloween Party ticket holders from 5pm. We arrived at 6pm and passed two ticket checks before entering and being directed by employees through Discoveryland. At this time the day's visitors were still in the park and were waiting in front of the castle for the Dreams show. It was pretty difficult to get to the other lands so we headed straight for Space Mountain and managed to get on within 20 minutes. We then approached the Buzz Lightyear ride only to be told by an employee that we needed a wristband to get access to the rides during the evening. Having passed two ticket checks without being given a wristband we were pretty annoyed to have to go right back to the entrance to collect them. This wasted a fair bit of time as we had to battle through the crowd of day visitors who were leaving the park. The spot where you collect the wristbands was very poorly indicated.By the time we got back to Discoveryland Buzz Lightyear had a 50 minute waiting time. We decided to try our luck with Indiana Jones and were really pleased to breeze onto the ride within 15 minutes. It was fantastic to ride the rollercoaster at night with views of the park.The Halloween events were about to start with Maleficent's parade. This was a bit of a let down as the parade only featured one float and a handful of Disney villains. Afterwards we went to grab a bite to eat at Videopolis and by chance caught the Goofy drums show which was really fun. We went back to Buzz Lightyear and queued for about 30 minutes. As we were queuing the band from Star Wars was playing and robot men were wandering around. We left Discoveryland and walked to Frontierland where we hoped to ride Thunder Mountain. Unfortunately this had a 70 minute wait time and the Fast Pass system was closed. We decided to give it a miss and just had a look around the area. People were queuing to meet Jack Skellington and the characters from Princess and the Frog  the queues were not too long. It was then time for the Halloween parade so we took our places (10 minutes before). The parade was harvest themed with beautifully designed floats and costumes. It was a nice touch that the floats were lit up in the dark. I would also have liked to have seen a spookier Halloween float to fit the event.After the parade it was difficult to get around with everybody moving in different directions. My biggest criticism of the night is that it was just far too overcrowded. I've been to Disneyland on busy Saturdays before and it was not nearly as bad as that night. Goodness knows how people with pushchairs managed it!We then went to Adventureland where we spotted Aladdin and Jasmine (this was again a queue up meet and greet scenario) It's a shame that characters don't pop out spontaneously at Disneyland, but I suppose it's too risky for them with the sheer number of people in the park. I expected to come across some street entertainment in this area but it seemed totally dead and very dark!After a walk around Adventureland we came back to the castle for Dreams. We were a bit late so had to watch from the side which was a bit of a shame as the effect of the animation on the castle is warped unless you're facing it head on. The programme said this was going to be a nightmarish Halloween themed Dreams  we must have missed that part in the first 5 minutes because to me it was just the regular Dreams sequence. By this time it was midnight so we reluctantly made our way to the exit in order to catch the last bus to the hotel. We didn't have time to check out Fantasyland (this closed before 11) and we missed the disco. Time was definitely an issue  if you factor in queuing and the time it takes to get around the park in large crowds it's really not possible to do everything. My advice would be to check the schedule and prioritise what you really want to do as the evening goes so quickly.We enjoyed ourselves at the party  we dressed up as characters from Frankenweenie and had a great time looking at the other visitors in their costumes. It was great to experience Halloween night at Disney but apart from being able to wear a costume I don't think it is much different to a regular day at the park.

227988881,2,France,"Visited Disneyland Paris last week, after almost 20 years, and thoroughly shocked by how shabby it has become. Perhaps Europeans who haven't visited either of the US Disney Parks don't know the difference, but it was a shock for us. It is in serious need of painting, repair of broken windows, replacement of burned out lights (some areas easily had 25% of the lights burned out, and some parts of the walk back to the parking lot after closing were totally without lights! If it was on purpose to save money or just in need up replacement, I don't know.The majority of the rides had parts that were not functioning. Also, whereas in the US there are usually 3 or more people operating a ride (e.g. Peter Pan), when we went on, the same person that was operating the controls was loading people & checking the safety bar was in place. The girl opening the doors on the Disneyland Railroad train didn't even notice that our 3 year old grandson was holding onto the door, and she almost caused him to be thrown onto the concrete platform when she opened the door.

If you are going as a group of adults, print multiple copies of each person's entrance ticket and make sure everyone has everyone else's tickets. Take a map of the park, decide which rides you wish to enjoy, and once you are in, split ways. Each person will then queue for fast pass tickets at a ride, so when you all meet up again, you have just saved yourselves a lot of queuing time.Don't expect the queues to be shorter in winter.

145651842,2,France,"OBJECTIVE REVIEW FROM ANNUAL PASS HOLDER   TOP TIPS: PLEASE READWe were annual pass holders for this park for a few consecutive years because we live close by, so my review is based on many visits. We are no longer frequent visitors mainly because of the following three reasons:1) the park is relatively small compared to the USA with fewer attractions, yet the park welcomes many visitors daily and wait times can be very long during school holidays (most summer, December) and weekends with average waits 25 90 minutes for most attractions. The worst rides are always Thunder Mountain and the Nemo coaster. It's difficult to find days that are quiet (usually limited to some wintry week days in Jan Feb)2) often the waiting lines are poorly managed and it is not unusual for parallel lines to move at significantly different speeds. Picking the right one requires some luck. This in combination with sometimes rude visitors cutting lines, pushing etc, has often caused us much frustration. 3) the worst thing is many many people smoking in the park, everywhere, all the time. There are constantly clouds of tobacco smoke drifting across your walking path. Smoking is not allowed in lines, but it's not really enforced. Just recently, I had a big argument with a visitor who flatly refused to put out their cigarette in a line, among children. On another occasion, I had to alert management of a group of teenage girls smoking marihuana in a line. I blame management for this as there should be a blanket ban that is continuously enforced, with widespread signs. Based on that, I feel the park deserves no more than one star, but my review has to stay objective and there are certainly also some good points about the park (beautifully landscaped, beautiful Cinderella castle, Nemo coaster)TOP TIPS:1) bear in mind the above points, so you are prepared. If possible, best to avoid visiting around any school holidays, the summer and weekends2) regardless, arrive either very early or arrive late to leave late during extended opening hours (weekends, summers). Waiting times drop off significantly a few hours before late closing hours as people get tired. Even better to split the day in two or visit 1 2 days several days. It's not an endurance race. Kids (and adults) get tired and cranky3) Walt Disney Studio's are fairly small but have some good attractions (Tower of Terror, Lilo & Stitch show, Nemo Coaster, Playhouse Disney show, Toystory land)4) get a fast pass as soon as you arrive (Thundermountain is a good bet). You can only get a fast pass for another attraction after the time has lapsed on the first one. No fast passes at Studio's.5) waiting time for the Nemo coaster at Walt Disney's studio's are usually long all day long, there is little point in postponing the wait. It's a very nice ride, worth the wait. Probably best for first thing in the morning6) quality of the food is not great and expensive. Best bets are the Hakuma Matata (fast food) or Blue Lagoon (table service, expensive). 7) if you are tired of the lines, try the slow train ride around the park, the steam boat, Adventure Island. Also, Phantom Manor's waiting times are also usually reasonable.",Disneyland_Paris,2012,unknown,Europe,negative,0.85,negative,negative,not_mentioned,negative,negative,negative,negative,not_mentioned,families,local,True,frequent,none,unknown,winter,weekend,True,True,False,True,False,False,unknown,Thunder Mountain;Nemo Coaster;Tower of Terror;Lilo & Stitch show;Playhouse Disney show;Toy Story land;Phantom Manor,False,no,Long wait times and poor crowd management,during_visit,major,long,good,True

144394794,1,France,"I took my son to Disneyland Paris two days ago. I wanted to have a special mother son day, and in his eyes, we probably did. BUT for such a highly reputed theme park, I have a hard time believing the good reviews. I've been living in France for 9 years and I fully understand that it is VERY hard to train French people about the hospitality industry, what the difference is between good service and bad. But the workers for the most part were unhappy in their own lives (maybe can't blame them if they're working at Disney), and not afraid to show it. I would like to think Disney has the means to train employees on being friendly, or even how to fake being friendly.That said   there is a system called  Fast Pass,  which did eliminate some of the queing time. But it was quite inefficient and had some restrictions. Inefficient because they would tell you to come back between 2   5 hours!! And you couldn't use it for more than 1 or 2 rides at a time. Now the biggest disappoinment to me was the FOOD. Never in my life, even from my simple grocer cheap discount food, have I had such terrible, awful food. The exception was the popcorn and candy apples. Every restaurant offered the same  American  fare, that was so flavorless that stating it  left a lot to be desired  would be a severe understatement. I am not a 5 star luxury diner and not someone who has the highest expectations either. I am a regular lower middle class person. But I would not be surprised AT ALL if the food they serve you comes from the same factory that prepares DOG FOOD. And maybe it's even below that. I mean really, Disney, how do you get away with that? OMG, my son loves  Ribs  and when we went to the  Western  style restaurant and he ordered ribs I thought he was being picky until I cut into them and tasted them. First of all, 90% of the  ribs  were blubber layered over a bone. What little meat there was, tasted like boiled mush   literally. They are serving premade microwave meals and I can tell you, with all honesty, that they are as low of quality as you can find. But you will pay a premium price for it. I am ready to write to Disney myself about this matter, because I would think a corporation with such a reputation would want to please their guests. However, this was just beyond disappointing. It was just flat out disgusting. Keep in mind, I am NOT a picky person!!! We also had a hotdog that tasted as if it were boiled beyond oblivion. I mean really, how hard is it to make a simple hotdog. I can do that myself with the cheapest hot dogs from the grocery store and it will taste better. I realize some people are just of a complaining nature and nothing is ever good enough. But this is why you should listen to my review, because I am not one of these. This is why I am writing this, because I really think you should read my warning, and I hope the people at Disney have a look at these reviews every once in a while too.In addition, I'm sorry, but there were a number of E. European guests who lack what W. Europeans would call manners. And then you have the French teenie boppers who are in heat in line behind you about to have sex while waiting. No discretion for public displays of affection.The Buzz Lightyear ride did have technical probs. And so did Indiana Jones, after we waited for 45 min. in line (posted waiting time was 30 min), then they told us it would be at least another 30 min and we left. It is just very, very tiresome to walk around with these huge crowds and stand in line for so many hours. I would suggest that Disney 1. outsources food services if they're incapable of delivering anything decent. 2. Set a maximum capacity for the park so that it isn't overcrowded and the guests can enjoy it.One last bad point   You know Paris has the same weather as London, right? Well you probably don't. I didn't. Now that I've been living here for 9 years, I can assure you that they might have 10% less rain, but that's it. It rains here nonstop. And it's very cold most of the year. You might have a 1 month window of good weather. But I'm sure the crowds during this period are intolerable. So I would just suggest avoiding this park at all costs. You would probably have a better time at one of the real Disney parks in the US if you can manage to save up enough to get over there.Hope this helped",Disneyland_Paris,2012,unknown,Europe,negative,0.95,negative,negative,not_mentioned,negative,negative,negative,not_mentioned,not_mentioned,families,local,True,first_time,none,unknown,unknown,unknown,True,True,False,True,False,False,unknown,Buzz Lightyear;Indiana Jones,False,no,poor food quality and staff friendliness,during_visit,major,long,good,True

143512258,4,France,"Visited in October 2012 with my husband and 4 year old. I think after 20 years its generally holding up well but could do a lot better in the following; toilet facilities in the restaurants and general park areas are not that clean and really need attendants with more regular servicing   disappointing. Food   at peak times midday and 7.30 8.00 pm the queues are out the doors and this is off season mid October so I dread to think what its like in July & August, more seated restaurant and takeaways with seated picnic areas are needed. Disney Paris need to up their game in terms of crowd control on the character appearances with cordonned off queuing as its just a free for all with ittle kids pushed all over the place and it can't be great for the characters either. Apart from these points though there is still plenty magic, on arrival the sight of Sleeping Beauty's castle just beyond Main St USA is wonderful, and the staging of each of the 4 lands looks great. Particular highlights for us were the dragon's cavern under the castle, Skull Rock and Captain Hook's pirate ship, everything in Fantasyland, Buzz Lightyears Laser Blast and of course the Disney shows. Mickey's Hallowe'en Treat in the Street show was very entertaining for younger kids and the Disney Dreams show at park closing (projected onto the Sleeping Beauty castle) is worth the entry price alone   its spectacular. One good thing thats new is in Fantasyland the theatre where you meet Mickey Mouse, the queuing system is genius you walk through a kind of cinema and there are mickey cartoons playing constantly and its the only queue that was a pleasure to be in as the kids were pre occupied with the cartoons, they should introduce this where they can in other attractions, its sure saves frayed nerves! Be sure to pick up a copy of the weekly events guide on arrival as this details the daily shows and character appearances, which are not listed on the general park map.

Adults very agressive in queues to jump ahead and BADLY behaved children trying to do the same and not reprimanded. We had tried to queue for Rapunzel and were told the queue was closed so tried next day....after 10 minutes in queue the new arrivals were told it was closed and went off. 30 minutes late a lady came and pushed her child under the barrier into a space behind me and ahead of others who didnt speak French, so I politely made her aware of situation, and that the other children had already been queueing for 40mins. She left and slid in behind the last family, who were English and couldnt defend themselves so I told her again and eventually the security removed her   do adults have to behave like that??? Most queues were teh same   you had to be premanently on alert and stand 4 wide to prevent queue jumpers   Seriously stressful!!2. Food is extortionate! You dont mind paying over the odds in a theme park but the food is shockingly BAD! We paid 51    for 3 burgers, 1 mangy hot dog, 4 mini chips & 3 drinks!!! It was disgusting! Suggest walking out to diners just outside park to eat or McDonalds on the way home. Nice restaurants like Blue Lagoon were asking 20    35   for main course....3. We had bought the girls 4 tickets (2each) at Auchan so they had an envelope with present of tickets for birthday, and bought our 4 on the day we arrived. No one tells you to keep one half of the ticket to go in and out of park   so did not know to ask when the girl took the evelope and handed us back the 2 intact tickets for the next day...Next day came to check in and were told that the 2 intact tickets had been used the day before!! The girl spoke french but was already on the verge of tears due to stress and when I tried to explain that we her colleague had taken teh tickets the day before and obviously marked these as used too she did not want to understand that there had been a mistake! It turned out she was Dutch but spoke neither English or French well enough or had the will to sort out the problem. Eventually I asked for her supervisor who also did not want to understand that his colleague from the day before must have made a mistake....

In my experience Disney is always good fun, the shows are always professional the staged street houses and gardens are always beautiful the rides don't change so if you like a ride the experience will be the same next time round!! It is also true to say the queues are always long the food is expensive and not great quality and the kids always want you to spend lots of money on toys sweets hats umbrellas sweat shirts etc which get dumped once at home. ( We got around this problem by dressing the kids in a Disney t shirt and always taking a Disney toy with us) It is amazing how the marketing works on you once you get through the Disney doors !!! The staff are French on the whole and there certainly is not an atmosphere of jolly comradeship and sometimes they can be quite sour though I promise you that for the French they are doing a very very good job at trying to be really nice, it's just not the same culture as an Anglo Saxon  American one. A word of warning, watch the weather forecast as if it is wet in Paris Disney will be wetter, the same goes for the cold, the sun, the wind etc.......we have been caught out on numerous occasions.

128402360,5,France,"We went there on a weekday and thus were able to avoid the long waiting lines. Maximum waiting time was around 20 minutes except for Peter Pan ride towards the end of the day. Many attractions close by 6'o clock so be sure to check the closing times of all the rides beforehand. That will allow you to make the most of your day. It will be a good idea to look at the available attractions beforehand otherwise you can feel lost initially in the Park. Must watch rides it's a small world: Children will love it too Peter Pan's Flight Big Thunder Mountain: For the people who love roller coasters Phantom Manor: Creepy but a nice to relax towards the end of the day Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril: For roller coaster lovers Pirates of the Caribbean: Nice to relax and roam around. Good for children Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast: Good for children but we enjoyed blasting the evil Z too  Space Mountain: Mission 2: Best roller coaster as far as I am concernedYou can get a fast pass, one at a time, for some of the major rides to avoid the lines and jump right ahead in the queue. Think of taking them for the roller coasters. Mix the big rides with other attractions to make the best use of time. Waiting time for disney train are long even on weekdays and places are few. Take the train at main station to be able to get a place. Walk around the park is also quite interesting. Remember to get good places to see the parade at 5 pm. Look for the place around 4:30, otherwise difficult to find them later on. Restaurants and eateries are available aplenty (may be a little bit too much) as is the shops selling memorabilia. Wares in these shops are very expensive.Make sure to reach there as early as possible. You will you the whole day easily. The park opens at 10 AM.

116968337,3,France,"While we left with huge smiles on our faces, but I can't imagine we ll be back soon. The cynicism turned our stomachs. Food and souvenir prices were beyond outrageous; Disney knowing full well that enough parents are simply going to cave in to their childrens' begging, since making them happy is why they agreed to subject themselves to endless queuing in the first place. F  k you, Disney Corp. Second complaint: some of the rides, I kid you not, last about two minutes. The Indiana Jones roller coaster is amazing, but over in a flash. Ditto the Orbitron. While occasionally the lines move quicker than the given estimates, seriously, how utterly infuriating. My friend actually queued with his two daughters for an hour, only to have the fire services close the ride moments before they were getting on. As to the staff: many friendly and helpful, many not quite so much. Also, would it kill them to post more direction signs? The maps provided can only help you orient so much when you can't see what's where through the throng of thousands of people. Otherwise, the parades and late evening sound and light shows were my favourite feature. Many things were done brilliantly.

116616689,4,France,"I was born inParis in the early 1970s and raised there, so this is the review of a true parisian on the Disneyland park in France. My first  encounter  with the disneyland was in 1990 when I was 17 and sent to California for a language trip to learn better English. I remember visiting Disneyland California and being incredibly impressed with 1) the rides, 2) the professionalism of it all and 3) the quality of the people and services. When  Euro  Disney opened back in 1992 (as it was called back then; it subsequently became  Disneyland Paris ), I was very enthusiastic and decided to visit the park immediately. I was not disappointed. Even if it was still small, the Disney magic had definitely been successfully exported; the sparkle was there I could tell. But then... a few years ago (it all started when the second park opened), I realized something had gone wrong with the magic. So, what can you expect   from my parisian perspective   in the Disneyland park in Paris? Well: if you are looking for a California or Florida type of experience, forget it. It's not there.  The rides are great at Disneyland Paris (I discussed with a few Americans and Brits who actually tell me they prefer some of the Paris attractions over those in CA or FL   for example Space Mountain   I don't; I simply love the genuine Space Mountain in CA or FL; so it is just a matter of taste).  However, the actual experience is not 100% fun. Why? Because not enough energy is put into making the park the  happiest place on earth . How? Simple yet unusual details for Disney:   shops: what on earth happened in the Disney shops??? Everything seems to be the same cheap stuff all over the place. Disney is known for its speciality shops (you'll definitely find many of these in FL). By specialty shops, I mean shops when you can purchase original Disney stuff, not just your regular Mickey T shirt.   food: oh my God! We are in a country which prides itself on serving good food. Disney serves food that   to me   is tasteless and SO expensive. I have tried many of their restaurants. The only nice place is actually oustide the Park at the Invention restaurant in the main Disney hotel where they have a decent buffet overlooking main street.    cleanliness: anyone who has ever visited Disney's toilets knows what I am talking about. I am revolted by the state of these toilets and ashamed for tourists.   service: yes, you will find Disney employees who are neither polite, nor kind, nor smiling in Paris, something which would rarely happen in CA or FL. I do not know if the staff is unhappy with their condition, but they certainly look unhappy and some of them are plainly rude and unprofessional with guests. I remember standing in line at a Disneyland ride and being told off by a Disney employee for having walked beyond a certain point (needless to say, no one had seen that  point ) in pretty agressive terms ( I did not tell you to keep walking , said the employee in a brisk manner without even saying hello or  sorry to have to mention this but it seems that...  I am paying to get scolded?). Their level of English is sometimes poor, at best.   disorganisation: even on peak days (like the heat of the summer) in CA or FL, everything runs smoothly in the overseas parks. In Paris, a simple glitch, such rain, creates a chaos and it takes hours to put the park back in motion. All in all, you are very likely to have an excellent day at Disneyland Paris but do manage your expectations; concentrate on the rides, they still are a lot of fun, not on the rest of it.",Disneyland_Paris,2011,unknown,Europe,negative,0.85,positive,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative,negative,not_mentioned,solo,local,False,returning,none,unknown,unknown,unknown,True,False,True,True,True,False,unknown,Space Mountain,True,no,"Poor service, cleanliness issues, and lack of quality in food and shops",during_visit,major,long,good,True
115605447,5,France,"Now I'm a massive cynic about these types of things (as is my partner), usually have zero interest in theme parks, even lower tolerance for childrens attractions and crowds, and hate the excessive consumerist culture that Disney promotes. Plus, after reading some of the reviews, I was bracing myself for a pretty, well, tedious day at best. BUT by the end of the day, we had to admit....we were Disney converts. Had a perfect day.This is a review for adults attending the park (we skipped a lot of the children stuff):We went as a group of four adults ranging in ages between 23 and 43, on a wednesday during grey weather (turned out to be a great idea as it kept the crowds down a little!). Waiting times for rides were never more than 40 minutes (at worst. On average we waited around 20 minutes for each, unless we used fastpasses, which are a godsend). If you're only interested in rollercoasters you can easily get everything done in one day, but for more you're going to be pressed for time. We started off by doing all the major 'grown up' rides except for one (loved them all), had lunch on the run   we brought a packed lunch, which I strongly suggest doing   then moved on to the slower paced attractions like the Pirates of the Caribbean, Armageddon, the Studio Tram Tour, Phantom Manor, and It's a Small World (okay, that last ones for kids but as you can see we were really getting into the spirit of things!), all of which was fun and unmissable. To our surprise we ended up staying until after dark and watching the parade and even enjoyed that! Even in the dreary weather after being on our feet for ten hours, walking around and watching the lights and parade was a lovely, and surprisingly romantic, ending to the day.My only 2 complaints: of course the food is expensive, don't be naive   it's Disneyland. But if you want to sit and have a 'decent' meal (ie not fast food) the options were a bit limited. We saw families and larger groups being turned away at the restaurant we ate at (Silver Spur Steakhouse)   one big tip is to either settle for fast food, or make a reservation ahead of time! Secondly, aside from the parades, we didnt see all that many characters (three or four in total), although I think that's due in part to our lack of organisation. I suppose next time we'll read the program and plan the day beforehand.I've read so many negative reviews here and it saddens me really. An experience is what YOU make it, and you have to put aside your need to judge and compare and just get into the spirit of things. It's Disneyland   you're there to have fun, not to focus on negatives. Describing it as 'run down'   really? We were pretty impressed with how it looked, and the cleanliness. The only thing being repaired was the ship at Pirates Beach. People have complained about the supposed rude service   I didnt see this at all (although maybe we dont notice it anymore as we live in France?), although I DID see a number of tourists being discourteous to staff members, and was genuinely disappointed to see the rude sense of expectation and entitlement that people seem to have when they visit there. Relax, people! Seeing parents with sour faces around their kids is really not cool.Me and my partner arrived home at 2am, tired but elatedly happy.

113183230,4,France,"We live in the area and have annual passes so we get to go a lot. If you are visiting Paris, you may not know that you can buy a  Billet Francilien  though you don't actually have to live in the area. The current special is valid until September 13. You chose the day you want to go, at least 5 days in advance and then you can go back for a 2nd free visit 7 days later. The price is    30 for one park on a weekday and    40 for the weekend for a child or an adult. Two parks cost    40 for a weekday and    50 for the weekend. Because we have the annual pass, we often hop parks based on the lines. But if I was a tourist, I would stay in one park one day and then do the other park the second day. Here is the link:http:  www.billetfrancilien.com Two other helpful things to know:You are allowed to carry in back packs with snacks and drinks. We do this each time. Also, there is a free iPhone app from Disneyland Paris that lists all the shows and line waiting times. Be sure to get the official Disney app. It's free, but there is more than one app and we have found the others to be inaccurate. If I was visiting Paris and felt like I had to pack it all in on one day, I don't know if I would like it as much. I know the French school holidays and we don't go on those days.

Took 1 hour to get on, 5 minutes for them to load us and in 2 minutes we were off! Second everything has a LONG line ... at least 90 minutes. The rides also suck! They are not that interesting...
